Most Important Points:
======================

1) Mesh:
========
	Mesh makeup a large part of your 3D world.unity provides a modeling tool called proBuilder & there are 
also some assets store modeling plugins,such as Mesh Deformer,UModeler,Mesh Editor.


2) Mesh Filter:
===============
	Mesh filter takes a meshes from your assets and pass it to "Mesh Render" for rendering on the screen.

3) Mesh Rernder:
================
	Mesh Render takes the geometry from "Mesh filter" & render it at the position defined by the GameObject's 
Transform and component.

4) Material and Texture:
=====================
	Firstly material apply to mesh and then texture apply on material.

5) Global/Local:
================
	In global mode arrow are aligned in world axes and local mode arrow shows the object direction.

6) Pivot/Center:
================
	x,y,z is a pivot and its origin is center.

7) Tag & layer:
===============
	We can set tag at every object for identify and layer for camera rendering.

8) Model import:
================
	"FBX" is the format.all imported files in project window. it is up to you how to import(drag & drop,from 
file menu option etc.) 

9) for build:
=============
	ctrl+shft+b

10) Game object:
===============
	set of collection (transform and component).

11) MonoBehaviour:
==================
	Monobehaviour is the base class and all functions and variables can call from that class to another class.

12) Methods:
============
	> Initialize:
	 ------------
	* "Awake()" is called varable or game state etc.
	* "Enable()" is called after awake method.
	* "Reset()" is called when the script is enabled and not palymode.
	* "Update()" method working on fps(frame per second).For Example: update works on 60 frames(pictures
	  /images) per second. 
	* "Start()" is called on the frame when script is enabled just before update method are called first time.

13) Delta Time and Space.World/Space.Self:
==========================================
	* "Delta Time(DT)" is the completion time in the second since last frame.For Example:Frame 1 executing,the
DT will be 0.Then game continue & frame 2 executing.so,the DT between 2 frames is 0.05 seconds.
NOTE: FPS(frame per second),DT value is changing continuously,for this example used 0.05.
Detail Example: suppose, we use fps = 20,
			speed = 10,
			Vector3.forward = 1,		
			DT is approximately erqualto 1/fps so,DT=0.05 (Here)
	totalMovement = fps*Vector3.forward*speed*DT = 10 Ans.
	* "Space.World" is the parameter which is used to say to move the object global/scene/world axis, not for self/local axis.
	* "Space.Self" is the parameter which is used to say to move the object local axis, not for world axis.

14) Writing method of Vector:
=============================
	* new Vector(0,0,0)
	* Vector.forward

15) Gizmo:
==========
	box collider or structures gizmo

16) Scene loading/Additive loading:
===================================
	Adds the Scene to the current loaded Scenes is called Additive means
